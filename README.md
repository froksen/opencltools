Problems?
-------
The program is still en heavy development and things might crash or in other way be unusable. But here are some ways that might help you.

*Things in 'Start chooser (Thing)' is in some other language than your own*
Either its because the things have not been translated into your language, or there for some reason the system things you are talking another language. Try removing the folder <programdir>/Databases and relanch the program.

*Sounds or images are missing*
